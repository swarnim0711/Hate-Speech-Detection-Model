# Hate-Speech-Detection-Model
There is no legal definition of hate speech because people’s opinions cannot easily be classified as hateful or offensive. Nevertheless, the United Nations defines hate speech as any type of verbal, written or behavioural communication that can attack or use discriminatory language regarding a person or a group of people based on their identity based on religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, ancestry, gender or any other identity factor.

Social media platforms need to detect hate speech and prevent it from going viral or ban it at the right time.
The dataset I’m using for the hate speech detection task is downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset was originally collected from Twitter and contains the following columns:

1.index

2.count

3.hate_speech

4.offensive_language

5.neither 

6.class

7.tweet 

 Hate speech is one of the serious issues we see on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook daily. Most of the posts containing hate speech can be found in the accounts of people with political views.
